Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher that can be used as a drop-in replacement for DES or IDEA. It takes a variable-length key, from 32 bits to 448 bits, making it ideal for both domestic and exportable use. Blowfish was designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier as a fast, free alternative to existing encryption algorithms. Since then it has been analyzed considerably, and it is slowly gaining acceptance as a strong encryption algorithm. Blowfish is unpatented and license-free, and is available free for all uses.

Blowfish 2 was released in 2005. It has exactly the same design but has twice as many S tables and uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers. It no longer works on 64-bit blocks but on 128-bit blocks like AES. 128-bit block, 64 rounds, key up to 4224 bits.

## About this project

This is a C++ implementation of the encryption algorithm.

## How to use this in your project?

1. You may fork it and use it like any other source file in your project. You only need [blowfish.hpp](include/blowfish/blowfish.hpp) and [blowfish.cpp](src/blowfish.cpp) files. Just modify the header as per your convienence. 
2. If you are using CMake, the work is lot easier. You can add this as a git submodule. It isolates your project from this dependency.

  ```bash
    # In your project root type these commands
    git submodule add https://github.com/avinal/blowfish
    # considering this addition is your only change
    git commit -m "blowfish submodule added"
    git push origin main
 ```

 Add this to your CMakeLists.txt as well.
